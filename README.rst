:``cb2_robot_example.py``:
    An example script which will move a robot around. You should be careful
    about running this before ensuring that it will not lead to a crash

How To Setup:
-------------
#. Install the packages: `python setup.py install`
#. Go to the home screen of PolyScope
#. Click on `SETUP Robot`
#. Click on `Setup NETWORK`
#. Set the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway to something
   intelligent, which matches the network on which the robot will be operating
#. Plug in the network cables.
#. Rock and roll (it is recommended to test by running `cb2-listen` from the
   command line)
#. Once everything is setup, you can import by: `import ur_cb2`,
   `import ur_cb2.receive`, and `import ur_cb2.send`
