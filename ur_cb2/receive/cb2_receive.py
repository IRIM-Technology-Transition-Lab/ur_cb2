    """A class to receive and process data from a UR Robot

    The receiving and processing can be run in a separate thread by calling
    start(). The stop() command must be called before exiting to halt the
    additional thread. Alternatively, receive(), decode(), and
    print_parsed_data() can be called in sequence in order to receive,
    decode, and print data. One should not call receive(), decode(), or any
    of the print methods, if a separate thread is being used. You should
    never write to any of the data fields externally, however you can read
    from them. Python's atomic read/write architecture should prevent you
    from getting any half baked results from basic types, for all lists and
    tuples, you must lock using lock (recommend that you use `with lock:`
    paradigm.
